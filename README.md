# Enhanced-Oral-Cancer-Analysis-using-Multi-Model-Fusion-and-GAN
Implemented VGG-16, ResNet-50 and Inception-v3 individually and then by concatenating their outputs for classification
of oral histopathological images as cancerous or non-cancerous. Further implemented Conditional GANs
for segmentation of images in cancerous and non-cancerous regions.
